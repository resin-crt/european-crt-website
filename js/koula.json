In most cases NGAs are the result of an upgrade of an already existing copper or co-axial access network .Next Generation Access (NGA) provision has been variable across Europe dependent on a country’s need. Essentially NGA provides the infrastructure to allow superfast broadband speeds of up to 100MB. Increasing population densities, for example, are thought to indicate a need for faster broadband access in the future. Therefore, given the reliance on social media for weather, risk and crisis information, superfast broadband may increase an area’s adaptive capacity.

GTSR (Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis) is an analysis of storm surges and extreme sea-levels based on hydrodynamic modelling (Muis et al, 2016). GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and provides estimates of extreme sea-levels values based on the period 1979-2014. The dataset is based on the application of two global hydrodynamic models: GTSM to simulate storm surges [Verlaan et al., 2015], and FES2012 to simulate tides [Carrere et al. 2012]. Surge levels were modelled by forcing GTSM with with 10 m wind speed and atmospheric pressure from the ERA-Interim climate reanalysis [Dee et al., 2011]. Total water levels are calculated by superimposing tides and surges. The 1-in-100 year sea level was estimated by fitting a Gumbel extreme value distribution to the annual maxima. The water levels included over 12,000 locations along the coastline defined as a centroid of the DIVA segments database.",

It has been found that even a 1°C increase in temperature can negatively affect the mortality of older people and over 70, 000 excess deaths in the 2003 European heatwave where age distribution affected mortality. This association has been demonstrated in several climatic contexts such as Sweden, Russia, and France. There are several reasons for this. Older people, for example, may have pre-existing health conditions which heighten their vulnerability during a heatwave, particularly respiratory conditions. Older people may also be socially isolated which can additionally heighten their vulnerability to heatwaves. That said, there is some discrepancy over the precise age when, for example, mortality during a heatwave begins to be significant. Similarly, older people are more sensitive to the effects of flooding due to a number of reasons. Often, they are socially isolated or tend to live in properties that are sensitive to floods. For this reason, old age is often correlated with increased sensitivity to flood. This relationship has been shown to be pronounced in rural, coastal areas. This means that older age is a high confidence indicator across a range of hazards. Owing to data availability, this indicator shows over-70s.

    "details": "This indicator shows the number of patent applications to the European Patent Office per 1000 population. Technology and innovation are important in helping a city to adapt to climate change e.g. investment in new flood technologies or building technologies that can help to mitigate heat. The ability of a country or urban area to invest in technological solutions, is thought to be an indicator of its adaptive capacity. Therefore, number of patents per year is used as a proxy indicator reflecting this issue. Ideally, the availability of adaptation solutions would be a direct indicator; however, such data is not typically collected on a city-by-city basis. he statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether (lack of) technology and innovation is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area.",

The resources that a city has can be a good indicator of a city’s sensitivity in terms of extreme weather events and climate change. If a city has a lower than average GVA, then it may have be more susceptible to damage from all types of extreme weather events.

This indicator calculates the proportion of the NUTS3 area that shows moderate (or higher) susceptibility to landslide. This indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether landslide hazard is a significant issue for the NUTS3 area. The key factor that influences landslide susceptibility is the presence of steep slopes. Others include bedrock and soil characteristics, deforestation and the presence of roads. Heavy rainfall can often trigger landslides. The typology portal includes an indicator on projected changes to the occurrence of very heavy rainfall days in NUTS3 areas. This can be used alongside the landslide hazard indicator, and also other indicators related to the exposure of people and infrastructure to landslides, to better understand this hazard in the NUTS3 area.",
