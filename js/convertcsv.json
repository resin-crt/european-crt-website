GTSR (Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis) is an analysis of storm surges and extreme sea-levels based on hydrodynamic modelling (Muis et al, 2016). GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and provides estimates of extreme sea-levels values based on the period 1979-2014. The dataset is based on the application of two global hydrodynamic models: GTSM to simulate storm surges [Verlaan et al., 2015], and FES2012 to simulate tides [Carrere et al. 2012]. Surge levels were modelled by forcing GTSM with with 10 m wind speed and atmospheric pressure from the ERA-Interim climate reanalysis [Dee et al., 2011]. Total water levels are calculated by superimposing tides and surges. The 1-in-100 year sea level was estimated by fitting a Gumbel extreme value distribution to the annual maxima. The water levels included over 12,000 locations along the coastline defined as a centroid of the DIVA segments database.",

      "details": "This indicator shows projected change in population more than 70 years as a percentage of the NUTS 3 unit between 2017 and 2050. The relationship between age and heatwaves is well-evidenced. It has been found that even a 1°C increase in temperature can negatively affect the mortality of older people (Bunker et al. 2016) and over 70, 000 excess deaths in the 2003 European heatwave where age distribution affected mortality (Robine et al. 2009). This association has been demonstrated in several climatic contexts such as Sweden (Rocklöv & Forsberg 2009), Russia (Barriopedro et al. 2011), France (La Tertre et al. 2006) There are a number of reasons for this. There are several reasons for this. Older people, for example, may have pre-existing health conditions which heighten their vulnerability during a heatwave, particularly respiratory conditions (Kovats & Kristie 2006; Rocklöv & Forsberg 2009). Older people may also be socially isolated which can additionally heighten their vulnerability to heatwaves (Toulemon and Barbieri 2008; Semenza et al., 1996, 1999). That said, there is some discrepancy over the precise age when, for example, mortality during a heatwave begins to be significant. For example, Kovats and Hajat (2006, cited in Swart et al. 2012) found that mortality was pronounced in the over-75’s and not significant between 65 and 74. Similarly, older people are more sensitive to the effects of flooding due to a number of reasons (Tapsell et al. 2002). Often, they are socially isolated or tend to live in properties that are sensitive to floods. For this reason, old age is often correlated with increased sensitivity to flood (see Green et al. 1994; Climate Just 2014). However, this relationship has been shown to be pronounced in rural, coastal areas (Oven et al. 2012). This means that older age is a high confidence indicator across a range of hazards. That said, there is some discrepancy over the precise age when, for example, mortality during a heatwave begins to be significant. For example, Kovats and Hajat (2006, cited in Swart et al. 2012) found that mortality was pronounced in the over-75’s and not significant between 65 and 74.
