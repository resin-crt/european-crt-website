The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of tropical nights is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area. The tropical nights indicator is used by the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/urban-adaptation-to-climate-change" target="_cf">European Environment Agency</a> who note that their occurrence is a crucial factor influencing the degree of health impacts associated with high temperatures in urban areas. The level of risk to people in the NUTS3 area from tropical nights (and associated heat wave days) will depend on factors including the proportion of elderly and young people in the population, groups who are particularly susceptible to harm from high temperatures. Indicator data on these factors is available within the typology portal.
This indicator shows the difference in the number of days with a maximum temperature of less than 0°C between the 1981-2010 period (observed baseline) and the 2036-2065 period (future projection).

There is no universal standard definition for a heat wave, although they are generally regarded as periods of extremely high temperature that exceeds a certain threshold (which varies depending on location and sector being considered) for a set number of days. Heat waves can negatively impact on people, ecosystems and infrastructure. The severity of impacts will depend on factors including the degree to which they are exposed to high temperatures and their vulnerability to this hazard. Vulnerability to heat waves is influenced by factors including the proportion of elderly and young people in the population and the extent of green space cover in urban areas. Indicator data on both of these factors is available within the typology portal. The severity and duration of the heat wave will also influence levels of associated risks. The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of heat waves is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area.

Projected change in consecutive wet days is not itself a climate change hazard. However, this indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can enhance understanding of how the climate of the NUTS3 area is projected to change over the coming decades. Considering this indicator alongside other related indicators can support this process. For example, where consecutive wet days are projected to increase, in addition to increases in heavy and very heavy precipitation days, this indicates that flood hazards may become more common within the NUTS3 area.
Heavy precipitation days is a globally recognised and standardised <a href="http://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/indicesdictionary.php#4" target="_cf">climate indicator</a>. This indicator shows the difference between the 1981-2010 period (observed baseline) and the 2036-2065 period (future projection) in the number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 10mm.

The EEA has defined drought as a natural phenomenon reflecting, ‘a sustained and extensive occurrence of below average water availability’ (EEA 2009: 11). Droughts are defined differently according to whether they are meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, environmental or socio-economic. This indicator utilises the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at nine month timescales, and therefore provides a measure of meteorological drought. A SPEI measure below 0 reflects a region where precipitation over a nine-month period is below the European average. A measure above 0 reflects a region where precipitation over a nine-month period is above the European average.
This indicator identifies the proportion of the NUTS 3 region defined as 'burnt areas' according to the 2012 Corine classification. This provides a sense of the extent to which wildfires have been a hazard in the past in the NUTS3 region. (Further details to follow).
This indicator shows the length of major road network in kilometres in a NUTS3 unit. Major roads are defined as ‘highways’ and include ‘motorway’, ‘trunk’, ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ and ‘tertiary’ segments of the network. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience. Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where road length is higher than average in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that there is redundancy in the road network and alternative routes can be found. This is also important from an emergency management point of view as during an extreme event, alternative means of providing key services and moving people may be found.
Length of railway network in NUTS3 unit. The rail network was sourced from open street map (2017) and includes standard gauge rail, subways, trams and light rail segments of the network. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience. Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where rail length is higher than average in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that there is redundancy in the rail network and alternative routes can be found. This is also important from an emergency management point of view as during an extreme event, alternative means of providing key services and moving people may be found.
This indicator shows the density of major road intersections per km2 of the NUTS3 unit. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience.  Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where there are more road intersections than the EU average  in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that there is redundancy in the road network and alternative routes can be found.  This is also important from an emergency management point of view as during an extreme event, alternative means of providing key services and moving people may be found.
This indicator shows the density of transport nodes per km2 of the NUTS3 unit. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience.  Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where there are more transport nodes than the EU average  in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that there is redundancy in the overall transport network and alternative routes/modes of travel can be found.  This is also important from an emergency management point of view as during an extreme event, alternative means of providing key services and moving people may be found.
This indicator shows the number of airports per head of population in the NUTS3 unit.  Redundancy is an important concept in resilience.  Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where there are more transport nodes than the EU average  in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that other airports can help to provide alternative routes/modes of travel.  This is also important from an emergency management point of view as during an extreme event, alternative means of providing key services and moving people may be found. \n
This indicator shows the number of ports per head of population in the NUTS3 unit. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience.  Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. Where there are more ports than the EU average  in a NUTS 3 area, this may signal that there is redundancy and alternative routes/methods of moving goods around can be found.  
This indicator shows the number of hospitals per head of population in the NUTS3 unit.The ability for the population to access hospitals and other medical units during an extreme weather event is of paramount importance. Where there are lower than average numbers of hospitals per head of the population, this may indicate that an area will experience intense pressure in ensuring that the population receive necessary medical support during, for example, a flood or a heatwave.  
This indicator shows the power plants per head of population in the NUTS3 unit. Redundancy is an important concept in resilience.  Redundancy demonstrates that there is excess capacity in given system means that during crises, the system may still be able to retain functionality. If there are more powerplants in a NUTS3 area than the EU average, this may mean that alternative ways of providing energy to a given population may be found. 
This indicator shows fixed broadband coverage. Fixed broadband data has been sourced from Point Topic’s Point Topic’s European Broadband Markets Service ocial media is becoming an increasingly common way of sharing risk information and warnings.  Therefore,  access to decent broadband is important in order to support the adaptive capacity of a given area. There may be more locally specific measures available that will give a greater insight into what this indicator is measuring e.g. % of population with access to a smart phone, and so on. 
Next Generation Access (NGA) provision has been sourced from Point Topic’s European Broadband Markets Service  . NGA are access networks which consist wholly or in part of optical elements and which are capable of delivering broadband access services with enhanced characteristics (such as higher throughput) as compared to those provided over already existing copper networks. In most cases NGAs are the result of an upgrade of an already existing copper or co-axial access network .Next Generation Access (NGA) provision has been variable across Europe dependent on a country’s need. Essentially NGA provides the infrastructure to allow superfast broadband speeds of up to 100MB. Increasing population densities, for example, are thought to indicate a need for faster broadband access in the future. Therefore, given the reliance on social media for weather, risk and crisis information, superfast broadband may increase an area’s adaptive capacity. Low NGA provision may indicate that policies should be put in place to prioritise NGA provision in the future. 
Fluvial flooding occurs when watercourses (rivers, streams) overflow and inundate the surrounding area. This indicator shows the percentage of the total population of the NUTS3 area living in settlements that would be exposed to flooding in the event of a 1 in 100 year fluvial flood. This indicator does not highlight the specific elements of the population living in settlements that would be affected in the event of a flood.

Averaged population density for the NUTS3 unit calculated over period 2010-2015.
Population density measures the concentration of individuals living in a particular spatial unit. Population density may be considered in tandem with hazard indicators relating to temperature and heatwaves as population density (which can be used as a proxy for the density of the built environment) may indicate more intense urban heat island effects (Swart et al. 2012).  On the other hand, where dense urban populations are supported by good infrastructure and resources, their climate resilience may be increased (UCCRN 2011) 
This indicator shows the % of total urban area in NUTS3 unit that is classified as green space (2012 data). There is robust evidence that green spaces can help city’s resilience to the effects of climate change and extreme weather events (Swart et al. 2012).  A lack of green space, as a % of the overall urban area, may indicate that a city is more sensitive to the effects of climate change and extreme weather events as it may lack the absorptive effects of green spaces in a flood, or the evapotranspiration effects of green spaces during a heatwave. Therefore, this indicator should be considered alongside these hazards. In addition, this indicator can also be considered alongside % total change in green space since an existing lack of green space, combined with a decreasing trend, may signal to city planners that more should be done in terms of increasing urban greening.
This indicator shows the built up urban area based on CORINE data. This includes continuous urban fabric (more than 80% of the land is covered by artificial surface cover), discontinuous urban fabric (where50% - 80% of the land is covered by artificial surface cover) and industrial, commercial and  transport units. There is robust evidence that the amount of artificial areas, such as buildings and other structures, intensifies heat and can exacerbate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This will make an area more sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and heatwaves
This indicator shows the change in % of total urban area in NUTS3 unit that is classified as green space (2009-2012 data).There is robust evidence that green spaces can help city’s resilience to the effects of climate change and extreme weather events (Swart et al. 2012).  Green spaces can help to absorb runoff during a flood. Green spaces can also help to reduce temperature due to evapotranspiration effects. Therefore, this indicator should be considered alongside hazards relating to flood and heat. A decreasing trend in green space, compared to the European average, may indicate increased sensitivity to the effects of these hazards and may signal to city planners that more should be done in terms of increasing urban greening.
This indicator shows the change in the % of the built up urban area based on CORINE data. This  includes continuous urban fabric (more than 80% of the land is covered by artificial surface cover), discontinuous urban fabric (where50% - 80% of the land is covered by artificial surface cover) and industrial, commercial and  transport units. There is robust evidence that the amount of artificial areas, such as buildings and other structures, intensifies heat and can exacerbate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This will make an area more sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and heatwaves. An increasing trend in built-up areas that is above the European average may indicate that a city is increasing in its sensitivity to high temperatures and heatwaves. 
Sensitivity to drought also includes a measure of soil moisture stress. When soil moisture is depleted, e.g. through reduced precipitation, this lack of soil moisture inhibits the effective functioning of natural and managed ecosystems.  The EEA use information on soil moisture content as a proxy for agricultural droughts. This indicator can be used in tandem with historic drought and projected water consumption in order to give an overall sense of the risk of drought to a NUTS 3 region. If soil moisture stress is higher than the European average, then a NUTS 3 region may be more sensitive to drought.
Drought occurs not only because of natural processes, but also because of pressures on the demand for water by users. Water consumption can be increased by a number of factors including a dense population and a period of hot and dry weather. It is important to understand the potential  water consumption pressure  in order to understand the risk of drought (in combination with soil moisture stress and historic instances of drought. If water consumption is higher than the EU average, policy makers may want to consider ‘softer’ measures to reduce user demand in greater detail. 
Priority allocations and expenditure on EU projects. Sourced from EU InfoRegion.\nThis indicator refers to the amount of Euros received in a NUTS3 region. More details to follow. \n
This indicator shows those living in a household with an 'equivalised disposable income' below 60 % of the national median, after taxes and social transfers (ESPON 2013). This is the European definition of poverty. This indicator is a proxy for deprivation. Those living in deprived areas may be more sensitive to climate change because of poor accommodation and an inability to prepare for an extreme event e.g. lack of insurance (ClimateJust 2014)
This indicator show projected change in population less than 15 years. This indicator shows how the % of population under 15 may change between 2017 and 2050. This indicator could be considered in the context of heat and flood indicators. Children and babies may be more sensitive during heat waves but there is less evidence about the significance of child deaths during heat waves (Swart et al. 2012). Children are also emotionally impacted upon after a flood and may lose out due to the subsequent instability in place of residence and education (Walker et al. 2010).  Additionally, this indicator may be considered alongside Projected Change in Population over 70 in terms of understanding the age-dependency. For example, if there is a projected decrease in the younger population combined with a projected increase in the older population, there may be differential effects in terms of the impacts of climate change e.g. more sensitivity to heat (ESPON 2011). \n
This indicator shows projected change in population more than 70 years. The relationship between age and heatwaves is well-evidenced. Older people, for example, may have pre-existing health conditions which heighten their sensitivity during a heatwave (Kovats & Kristie 2006). Similarly, older people are more sensitive to the effects of flooding due to a number of reasons. Often, they are socially isolated or tend to live in properties that are sensitive to floods. For this reason, older age is often correlated with increased sensitivity to flood (see Green et al. 1994; Climate Just 2014).  This means that older age is a high confidence indicator across a range of hazards. That said, there is some discrepancy over the precise age when, for example, mortality during a heatwave begins to be significant. For example, Kovats and Hajat (2006, cited in Swart et al. 2012) found that mortality was pronounced in the over-75’s and not significant between 65 and 74. Owing to data availability, this indicator shows over-70s.\n 
This indicator shows the % change in population through migration in NUTS3 unit between 2017-2050.  There is some debate in the literature over the extent to which a population with a high number of recent migrants may indicate increased sensitivity to extreme weather events and climate change because, for example, they may live in sub-standard housing or to communicate ill-health (e.g. Cutter 2003; Kazmierczak and Cavan 2011; Tapia et al. 2015). \nDecreases in migration, when combined with other population indicators such as age, may indicate that there is an aging population.\n
Projected Change in Total Population and NUTS 3 Density. Increasing population and density will interact with the effects of climate change and may render a NUTS 3 region more sensitive to the effects of climate change. For example, increased density may interact with high temperatures to increase the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Increased population may put pressure on resources in order to devise strategies for dealing with the effects of climate change. 
This indicator shows the employment-population balance. The ratio of jobs to people can be an important indication of economic concerns within an area. When thinking about the way that the employment-population balance works in a given area, there may be particular interactions with climate resilience. For example, where there are more jobs than people (e.g. central London) this may indicate a high number of commuters, which may put pressure on a city’s resources, particularly its transport infrastructure, to deal with extreme weather events. In addition, there may be issues with getting supporting people to fill vacant jobs (e.g. in a hospital) during an extreme weather event when existing staff cannot travel. (Description to be enhanced in the future).
This indicator shows the number  of patent applications to the European Patent Office per 1000 population.  Technology and innovation are important in helping a city to adapt to climate change e.g. investment in new flood technologies or building technologies that can help to mitigate heat. The ability of a country or urban area to invest in technological solutions, is thought to be an indicator of its adaptive capacity (Grieving et al. 2011; Swart et al. 2012; Acosta et al. 2013). Therefore, number of patents per year is used as a proxy indicator reflecting this issue. Ideally, the availability of adaptation solutions would be a direct indicator; however, such data is not typically collected on a city-by-city basis.\n
Gross Value Added (GVA) is defined as output value at basic prices less intermediate consumption valued at purchasers' prices. GVA is calculated before consumption of fixed capital.  The resources that a city has can be a good indicator of a city’s sensitivity in terms of extreme weather events and climate change. If a city has a lower than average GVA, then it may have be more susceptible to damage from all types of extreme weather events. A city with low resources may not be able to adequately address climate change adaptation due to other pressures. 
This indicator shows the percentage of the total area of the NUTS3 area that would be exposed to flooding in the event of a 1 in 100 year fluvial flood. Fluvial flooding occurs when watercourses (rivers, streams) overflow and inundate the surrounding area. The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether fluvial flooding is a significant issue for the NUTS3 area. Also, this indicator can be considered alongside others included in the typology portal that show the extent of exposure of people and infrastructure to fluvial flooding in the NUTS3 area.
This indicator draws on NASA’s Global Landslide Susceptibility Map, which identifies the potential for landslides across the Earth’s surface on a scale from slight to severe. This indicator calculates the proportion of all areas that are susceptible to landslide in the NUTS3 area where the potential for landslide is moderate or higher. This indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether landslide hazard is a significant issue for the NUTS3 area. The key factor that influences landslide susceptibility is the presence of steep slopes. Others include bedrock and soil characteristics, deforestation and the presence of roads. Heavy rainfall can often trigger landslides. The typology portal includes an indicator on projected changes to the occurrence of very heavy rainfall days in NUTS3 areas. This can be used alongside the landslide hazard indicator, and also other indicators related to the exposure of people and infrastructure to landslides, to better understand this hazard in the NUTS3 area.

Projected change in daily mean temperature is not itself a climate change hazard. However, this indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can enhance understanding of how the climate of the NUTS3 area is projected to change over the coming decades. 
Consecutive dry days is a globally recognised and standardised <a href="http://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/indicesdictionary.php#4" target="_cf">climate indicator</a>.

Projected change in consecutive wet days is not itself a climate change hazard. However, this indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can enhance understanding of how the climate of the NUTS3 area is projected to change over the coming decades. Considering this indicator alongside other related indicators can support this process. For example, where consecutive wet days are projected to increase, in addition to increases in heavy and very heavy precipitation days, this indicates that flood hazards may become more common within the NUTS3 area.

Where the frequency of heavy precipitation days is projected to increase, this indicates that flood hazards may also increase (although flooding is driven by multiple other factors including land use change). The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of heavy precipitation days is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area.

The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of frost days is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area. The number of frost days is decreasing across Europe, and the impacts of this shift may be positive or negative depending on the location being considered and related factors including the nature of dominant industries and land uses.
This indicator shows the difference in the number of days with a maximum temperature more than 25°C between the 1981-2010 period (observed baseline) and the 2036-2065 period (future projection). The future projection is developed for a medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway (<a href="http://sedac.ipcc-data.org/ddc/ar5_scenario_process/RCPs.html" target="_cf">4.5 scenario</a>). The 25°C temperature threshold for summer days is a globally recognised and standardised <a href="http://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/indicesdictionary.php#4" target="_cf">climate indicator</a>. The supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) provides further information on this indicator in the context of the NUTS3 area. Although the summer days threshold of 25°C does not pose a threat to the majority of people and infrastructure, it can be considered alongside other heat-related indicators to better understand projected changes in temperature and related hazards in the NUTS3 area. 
This indicator shows the difference in the number of nights where the minimum temperature does not drop below 20°C between the 1981-2010 period (observed baseline) and the 2036-2065 period (future projection).

The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of tropical nights is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area. The tropical nights indicator is used by the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/urban-adaptation-to-climate-change" target="_cf">European Environment Agency</a> who note that their occurrence is a crucial factor influencing the degree of health impacts associated with high temperatures in urban areas. The level of risk to people in the NUTS3 area from tropical nights (and associated heat wave days) will depend on factors including the proportion of elderly and young people in the population, groups who are particularly susceptible to harm from high temperatures. Indicator data on these factors is available within the typology portal.
This indicator shows the difference in the number of days with a maximum temperature of less than 0°C between the 1981-2010 period (observed baseline) and the 2036-2065 period (future projection).

There is no universal standard definition for a heat wave, although they are generally regarded as periods of extremely high temperature that exceeds a certain threshold (which varies depending on location and sector being considered) for a set number of days. Heat waves can negatively impact on people, ecosystems and infrastructure. The severity of impacts will depend on factors including the degree to which they are exposed to high temperatures and their vulnerability to this hazard. Vulnerability to heat waves is influenced by factors including the proportion of elderly and young people in the population and the extent of green space cover in urban areas. Indicator data on both of these factors is available within the typology portal. The severity and duration of the heat wave will also influence levels of associated risks. The statistical data provided for this indicator (the Z-Score) can be used to better understand whether change in the number of heat waves is a potentially significant issue for the NUTS3 area.
Total wet-day precipitation is a globally recognised and standardised <a href="http://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/userguidance/indicesdictionary.php#4" target="_cf">climate indicator</a>.

Projected change in total wet day precipitation is not itself a climate change hazard. However, this indicator and the supporting statistical data (the Z-Score) can enhance understanding of how the climate of the NUTS3 area is projected to change over the coming decades.
