1 metre sea level rise inundation area defined by CReSIS (www.cresis.ku.edu/content/research/maps). GTSR (Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis) is an analysis of storm surges and extreme sea-levels based on hydrodynamic modelling (Muis et al, 2016). GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and provides estimates of extreme sea-levels values based on the period 1979-2014. The dataset is based on the application of two global hydrodynamic models: GTSM to simulate storm surges [Verlaan et al., 2015], and FES2012 to simulate tides [Carrere et al. 2012]. Surge levels were modelled by forcing GTSM with with 10 m wind speed and atmospheric pressure from the ERA-Interim climate reanalysis [Dee et al., 2011]. Total water levels are calculated by superimposing tides and surges.  The 1-in-100 year sea level was estimated by fitting a Gumbel extreme value distribution to the annual maxima. The water levels included over 12,000 locations along the coastline defined as a centroid of the DIVA segments database.
This indicator is derived using a global gridded dataset of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at nine month timescales. 
This indicator is developed by calculating the proportion of the NUTS 3 region that is defined as 'burnt areas' according to the 2012 Corine classification.
